# Vento

## Server Repo

> This is the server side, for the [client](https://github.com/geroalexander/vento_client) side, navigate to another repository.

Vento is a lightweight application built for small and medium sized restaurant kitchens, that combines an inventory management system with a task organiser.

1. Communications within the kitchen team, making handovers during shift change and shift end _fluid and reliable_.
2. Improving the efficency of each individual kitchen section by _providing an overview_ of the required tasks to be completed.
3. Contributing to higher job satisfaction by adressing the serious lack of IT solutions for _back of house_ hospitality operations.
